          <ul class="geninstruction">
            <li>The form is meant for financial assistance from  REC to IPPs/CPPs in Private Sector </li>
            <li>All annexures/attachments to the Loan Application Form should be duly signed and stamped. If particular information is not applicable or is nil, same should be properly indicated and should not be left blank. The hard copy of the annexures/attachments to the Loan Application Form should also be sent in original separately</li>
            <li>The form is divided into 2 sections-<br>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Section A-</strong>	It is general information pertaining to Borrower Company.</li>
                <li><strong>Section B-</strong> Entity Appraisal Information-This section deals with information pertaining to entities contributing equity to the project. All such entities are called promoters in REC</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>REC is committed to do appraisal as per Fair Practice Code (FPC). FPC is available on website of the Corporation which may please be seen. (<a href="http://recindia.com/" target="_blank">www.recindia.com</a>)</li>
            <li> <strong>Rating Methodology and Rationale-</strong><br>
              REC rates each project primarily on two parameters-
              <ul>
                <li>Creditworthiness of promoters and their ability to bring in requisite equity and also the management/promoters capability to effectively manage the project is judged under Entity Appraisal.</li>
                <li>Technical and commercial viability of the project which is judged under Project Appraisal.</li>
              </ul>
              Each project is appraised as per merits based on Integrated Rating methodology approved by the Board of Directors. Grades obtained under Entity and Project Appraisal are integrated to arrive at a single rating called Integrated Rating (IR). There are six integrated grades ranging from IR 1– IR VI in which each project is categorized  which mainly effects rate of interest, upfront fees, lead fees, upfront equity, debt equity ratio etc. IR I is the best grade. IR VI is the worst grade which is considered speculative and not considered for funding by REC.<br>
            </li>
            <li> The broad parameters presently taken into account in Entity and Project Appraisal are as follows:
              <h5><u>Part A -Entity Appraisal Parameters</u></h5>
              <ul class="headlist">
                <li> <span>Business Risk Analysis</span><br>
                  The business risk score is based on the prospects of the sectors the company operates in and the position of the company in its businesses on operating efficiency and market position in comparison to the sector average, or the major peers</li>
                <li> <span>Financial Risk Analysis</span><br>
                  The financial risk score takes into account the recent three-year financial performance and also the Projected financials of the Company/Promoters till Scheduled COD of the project, and is also adjusted for concerns related to accounting qualityand defaults in payment of dues to lenders/banks/FIs etc </li>

                  This covers the assessment of Equity funding potential of the promoters </li>
